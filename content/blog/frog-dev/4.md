## Home Page

After playing around with my browser size to enjoy my responsive header design, it's time to build out a page! I might as well start with the home page - it's not *content* per se, but it's the entry point to the site and deserves attention.

I did a little research and found some home page designs I like, which I can use for reference. To start, a big hero image I can point to whatever content I want. Along with the header, this will take up most if not all of the space above the fold. Next, a couple of columns to give the user some variety. On the left will be my latest articles, and on the right my About Me content (the same as my `/about` page) and links to my projects. This gives the two columns a nice staggered look. On mobile, these columns collapse into a single column.

### Featured post

The featured post card is pretty straightforward. It's just a link with an image, title, and description. I added a "Featured Post" tag at the top to signify the importance of the element to the user.

```vue-html
<NuxtLink class="featured-post card" :to="featuredPost?._path">
  <div class="featured-post__tag">Featured Post</div>
  <img class="featured-post__image" :src="featuredPost?.cover_image" />
  <div class="featured-post__body">
    <div class="featured-post__title">
      {{ featuredPost?.title }}
    </div>
    <div class="featured-post__description">
      {{ featuredPost?.description }}
    </div>
  </div>
</NuxtLink>
```

The `featuredPost` article is pulled from `/content/blog` using `queryContent()`, which looks for the first article it can find with the `featured` tag.

```js
const { data: featuredPost } = await useAsyncData("featured-post", () =>
  queryContent("blog").where({ tags: { $contains: "featured" } })
  .findOne())
```

### Latest articles

For the Latest Articles column, I want an article card component I can re-use in the `/blog` page. I'll build something really similar to the featured post card, then render one for each article in my list.

```vue-html
<ArticleCard
  v-for="article in articles"
  :article="article" />
```

To fetch the articles, I use the same `queryContent()` function to fetch `listed` articles from the search component, but this time I limit the results to 5 items.

```js
const { data: articles } = await useAsyncData('latest-article-list', () =>
  queryContent('blog').where({ tags: { $contains: "listed" } })
  .limit(5).find())
```

### About me

For the about me section, I want to render the cover image of my `/about` article, along with the article content. I can do this with the `ContentDoc` component from Nuxt Content, which is the same component I'll use in my article pages.

```vue-html
<img
  v-if="about?.cover_image"
  class="home__column__image"
  :src="about?.cover_image" />
<ContentDoc path="/about" />
```

I get the article content from `/article` with `queryContent()`, I'm sure you get it by now.

```js
const { data: about } = await useAsyncData('about', () =>
  queryContent('about').findOne())
```

### Projects

The project cards are very similar to the article cards, but simpler. I have an link that opens the project in a new tab, with an image and the name of the project.

```vue-html
<div v-for="project in projects">
  <NuxtLink
    class="project-card"
    :to="project.link"
    target="_blank">
    <div class="project-card__tag">{{ project.title }}</div>
    <img class="project-card__image" :src="project.image" />
  </NuxtLink>
</div>
```

The project information is not content, and not queried with `queryContent()`. I just put an array of project information in the Home page script and pass that in to the template.

```js
const projects = [{
  image: 'https://frog-dev.b-cdn.net/my-fun-image-link.png',
  title: 'croak.io',
  link: 'https://croak.io'
}, {
  image: 'https://frog-dev.b-cdn.net/my-other-fun-image-link.png',
  title: 'manticorebook.com',
  link: 'https://manticorebook.com'
}]
```

That's the home page! Let's get to some content!
