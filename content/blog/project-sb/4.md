## Game Objects

### Board Spaces

The first custom game objects I wanted to make were the board spaces that define the layout of the game board. These game spaces would be configured with references to the next space(s) as well as custom behavior for pointing to the next space with an arrow. When game objects require additional configuration or behavior beyond what's provided in the editor, it's time to create a class.

Unreal Engine provides a lot of classes in the Unreal Engine library, and with the power of inheritance developers can extend these classes as they see fit. One of these classes is AActor, which represents a game object that can be placed or spawned in a level (like the one I just created). That's all the Unreal Engine behavior my class needed (the rest will be my own custom behavior), so this seemed like a good parent to inherit from.

I right-clicked in the C++ section of the content drawer and created a new class called ABoardSpace, selecting AActor as its parent. This pulls all the functionality of AActor into my ABoardSpace class and allows me to add whatever code I want on top of it. I opened the new class in my IDE, Rider, and navigated to the the header file for this class (ABoardSpace.h). Within the header file is the definition of the class, to which I added my first custom property - a UStaticMeshComponent* variable. This component allows me to set the object's 3D mesh as a variable, so I can choose what the board spaces look like. I gave this variable a UPROPERTY configuration set to VisibleAnywhere so I can view this component in the editor and choose a mesh. In addition to the mesh component, I added a TArray of ABoardSpace pointers called NextSpaces. This stores references to other spaces the player can move to from this space. I gave this a UPROPERTY configuration of EditInstanceOnly to set the values individually for each space, since each space has different neighbors.

```cpp
UCLASS()
class SB_API ABoardSpace : public AActor
{
  GENERATED_BODY()
 
public:   
  ABoardSpace();

protected:
  UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
  UStaticMeshComponent* Mesh;

  UPROPERTY(EditInstanceOnly, Category = "Board Space")
  TArray<ABoardSpace*> NextSpaces;

};
```

With this new C++ class, I could create a new Blueprint class that inherits from it in the Unreal Engine editor. This is a required step to me set the fields I surfaced to the editor in the UPROPERTY configuration, in this case the mesh. I opened the blueprint class, found the static mesh component, and gave it a simple platform mesh from the StarterContent. I threw a marble material onto the mesh to make it stand out a bit, shrunk the mesh to a reasonable size, then dragged a few spaces onto the board to create a path. With the path in place, I selected the spaces one by one and set the NextSpaces references to their neighbors. This was already starting to look like a game board!

### Characters

Next I wanted to add characters to the board. These characters represent the players' position on the board and walk from space to space. I created a GameCharacter class that derives from ACharacter, another Unreal Engine class that has mesh, collision, and movement logic. I created a new blueprint class from GameCharacter in my editor, and set the mesh to a mannequin. I dragged a few onto my game board, but they were lifeless without any game logic. The next step was to control these game pieces with code.
