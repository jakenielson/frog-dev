## Breaking Ground

With some idea of where to start, I opened a new blank project in the Unreal Engine editor. I opted in to the Starter Content - basic meshes and materials for protyping are always handy. The editor popped open, and I went to work providing some initial structure with a few top-level folders. In the Levels folder, I created my first asset - a Level called BoardTest.

### Atmosphere

I opened up my BoardTest level and saw darkness in all directions, broken up by a 2-d grid at ground level. This was good - Unreal Engine hadn't added anything to this level yet that I didn't want. I had a blank canvas. Without any objects or lighting there was nothing to see, so I started building.

I added a DirectionalLight, a sun-like effect, to bask the whole level with light. At least, it was supposed to. Even with light there was still nothing to see. The level needed some atomsphere to wrap the world in texture. I added a SkyAtmosphere to fill the sky with color, ExponentialHeightFog filled the area below with fog, and a VolumetricCloud put some clouds to the sky. I wrapped it all together with a Skylight, which bakes all of these elements into the level's lighting. Now I could see!

### Game Board

If I could see, I could build. Time to get back to the game board. The first thing to build was the board itself, a big flat plane with enough space to hold a few rows and columns of spaces. This can be done very simply - I added a Cube shape to the level, and resized it to the correct shape. I threw a wood texture on it looks like a board. Quick and easy, and now I could build some real game objects.
