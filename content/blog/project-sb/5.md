## Controlling the Game

### Player Turns

When managing the overall rules of the game, like how turns are managed, Unreal Engine recommends using the Game Mode and Game State. Game Mode controls the rules of the game, while Game State holds information about the current state of the game. The Game Mode and other classes can reference the Game State when making decisions. For now, I configured my Game State class to track the players in the game, their turn order, and whose turn it is. Then I gave the Game Mode a public function to end the current turn and begin the next turn.

```cpp
UCLASS()
class SB_API ASBGameState : public AGameState
{
  GENERATED_BODY()

public:
  ASBGameState();
  FORCEINLINE ETurnState GetTurnState() const { return TurnState; }
  FORCEINLINE void SetTurnState(const ETurnState& NewTurnState) { TurnState = NewTurnState; }
  FORCEINLINE int32 GetActiveCharacterIndex() const { return ActiveCharacterIndex; }
  FORCEINLINE void SetActiveCharacterIndex(const int32& NewCharacterIndex) { ActiveCharacterIndex = NewCharacterIndex; }
  FORCEINLINE AGameCharacter* GetActiveCharacter() const { return CharacterTurnOrderArray[ActiveCharacterIndex]; }

  void AddCharacterTurn(AGameCharacter* Player);
  bool IsLastCharacterTurn() const;

private:
  ETurnState TurnState;
  int32 ActiveCharacterIndex;

  UPROPERTY()
  TArray<AGameCharacter*> CharacterTurnOrderArray;
};

```

```cpp
UCLASS()
class SB_API ASBGameMode : public AGameMode
{
  GENERATED_BODY()

public:
  ASBGameMode();
  virtual void BeginPlay() override;
  void EndTurn() const;

private:
  void StartPlayerTurn() const;
  void NextPlayerTurn() const;
  void StartGameTurn() const;
  void EndPlayerTurn() const;
  void EndGameTurn() const;
 
};
```

Now that the current player was being tracked in the Game State, I created a Player Controller class and wrote a BeginTurn function to handle everything that needs to happen when a turn begins. For now it calls SetActiveCharacter, another function that reads the active character from the Game State and sets it as a class member variable. Since the active character only changes when a turn is passed, it should be efficient to sync with the Game State once per turn like this. I also added an EndTurn function that uses the Game Mode to end the turn, then calls BeginTurn.

```cpp
void ASBPlayerController::BeginTurn()
{
  SetActiveCharacter();
  InputEnabled = true;
}

void ASBPlayerController::SetActiveCharacter()
{
  if (const ASBGameState* GameState = GetGameState())
  {
     ActiveCharacter = GameState->GetActiveCharacter();
  }
}
```

### Input

I had controls for handling the player turn, but next I needed the user's input so the controls can be used. To do this, I opened my Input folder in the content drawer and created an Input Mapping Context and Input Actions. I named the Input Mapping Context IMC_Rolling, because the first thing the player should do on their turn is roll a die. The only input action I needed was for rolling the die, so I named that one need an IA_Roll.

To tie these to my class, I added private variables for this input context and input action, then bound IA_Roll to a new function called Roll. Roll checks if my InputEnabled flag is true, then calls CheckCurrentSpaceAndMove - which hasn't been defined yet. This is getting outside of input territory and into movement logic, so I'll talk about that next.

```cpp
void ASBPlayerController::SetupInputComponent()
{
  Super::SetupInputComponent();

  if (UEnhancedInputComponent* EnhancedInputComponent = CastChecked<UEnhancedInputComponent>(InputComponent))
  {
     EnhancedInputComponent->BindAction(RollAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &ASBPlayerController::Roll);
  }
}

void ASBPlayerController::Roll()
{
  if (InputEnabled)
  {
     CheckCurrentSpaceAndMove();
  }
}
```
