## Project SB

Welcome to the dev log for Project SB! Working title. In these articles I'll meticulously step through my development process, provide code examples, explain my thought process, and show the in-engine results of my work. You should be able to follow along step by step and see the same results in your project. Whether you follow along or not, I think this will reduce the opacity of the engine and help you get started on your own project!

First, a little background. I have a few years experience as a software engineer, primarily working in Javascript. Unreal Engine code is written in C++. So while I'm not a complete beginner to programming, I am relatively new to game programming and C++. So if you're new and wondering how I figure out the solutions to the problems I encounter in this project, it comes with experience. And if you're a C++ expert and screwing your nose at my code, please send me your feedback!

Now let's recap.
