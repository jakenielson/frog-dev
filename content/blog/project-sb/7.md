## Making Choices

### Intersections

So with the way things were currently implemented, the player could move along a path of game spaces, but still can't make a choice when they reached an intersection. To change this, I needed a few things. A new input context and input actions for the intersection player state, a visual signifier so the player knows what space is being previewed, and logic connecting the player controller through to the current board space.

I added a new context called IMC_Intersection and two new actions called IA_ChangeSpace and IA_SelectSpace, then bound the actions the same way I did with the rolling context actions. SelectSpace was bound to a new LeaveIntersection function, which calls the character's MoveToPreviewSpace function, sets the mapping context back to Rolling, and disables the input. ChangeSpace was bound to a new PreviewSpaceInDirection function, which gets the vector value from the input and passes it into a new function on the GameCharacter class, also called PreviewSpaceInDirection. This function calls the PreviewSpaceInDirection function of the current space, which uses the position of the current preview space and the input vector to find the closest space in the direction the player indicated. It then sets the preview space to this new space. Then the character faces the preview space and tells the CurrentSpace to PointAtPreviewSpace.

```cpp
void ASBPlayerController::SetupInputComponent()
{
  Super::SetupInputComponent();


  if (UEnhancedInputComponent* EnhancedInputComponent = CastChecked<UEnhancedInputComponent>(InputComponent))
  {
     EnhancedInputComponent->BindAction(RollAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &ASBPlayerController::Roll);
     EnhancedInputComponent->BindAction(ChangeTileAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &ASBPlayerController::PreviewSpaceInDirection);
     EnhancedInputComponent->BindAction(SelectTileAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &ASBPlayerController::LeaveIntersection);
  }
}

void ASBPlayerController::EnterIntersection()
{
  if (!ActiveCharacter) return;
  AddMappingContext(IntersectionInputContext);
  InputEnabled = true;
}

void ASBPlayerController::PreviewSpaceInDirection(const FInputActionValue& Value)
{
  if (!InputEnabled || !ActiveCharacter) return;
  const FVector2D DirectionValue = Value.Get<FVector2D>();
  ActiveCharacter->PreviewSpaceInDirection(DirectionValue);
}

void ASBPlayerController::LeaveIntersection()
{
  if (InputEnabled && ActiveCharacter)
  {
     ActiveCharacter->MoveToPreviewSpace();
     AddMappingContext(RollingInputContext);
     InputEnabled = false;
  }
}

void ASBPlayerController::LeaveIntersection()
{
  if (InputEnabled && ActiveCharacter)
  {
     ActiveCharacter->MoveToPreviewSpace();
     AddMappingContext(RollingInputContext);
     InputEnabled = false;
  }
}
```

For PointAtPreviewSpace to work, I needed to add some kind of visual indicator so the player knows what space is being previewed (besides inferring from the direction the character is facing). I remember seeing a visual indicator when clicking the mouse in the Unreal Engine top-down project, so I poked around in there for a while. I discovered they're using a Niagara particle effect to create this indicator, which scrolls a texture across a mesh to create a moving arrow. I followed this same pattern but simplified it a bit, just scrolling a single arrow over a flat plane. I created the asset in Blender, then spawned the asset using a SimpleSpriteBurst Niagara system. Inside the system I connected the lifetime of the particle to the Y offset of the material's texture.

And that's it! Tune in to the next dev log!
