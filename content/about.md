I'm a web developer - full time, full stack. I started my career in software QA, self-taught Javascript and React, and dove head-first into the industry in 2017. Now I'm leading a small team doing big things in the eCommerce space. At heart, I'm a game developer. Years before I was a QA, I was plugging away at a GameMaker Studio game called Dungeon Boy. Now I'm getting back to my roots and building a multiplayer web game at [croak.io](https://croak.io). Thanks for stopping by! Check out my blog, my projects, and maybe say hello!
