Hi! I built this site from my little house in the PNW mountains. I am a professional web developer by day and a game developer by night. I love working with people and tackling big problems at my job, but I'll always have my own little passion projects that I work on at home. I love Dungeons & Dragons, horror manga, dance music, and frogs. Thanks for stopping by, check out my latest article!
